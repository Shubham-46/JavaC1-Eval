Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write some
of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

Ans=>String are not primitive data types and it is immutable because it gets unsecure if we make changes or modification in string.
String=>
String's are immutable and we cannot change or modifiy it 
String can be declare one time not after that it will be the same string 

String Builder=>
As compare to the string, String builder can be modifiy
While String builder can be reassigned and remodified.


Example
class shubham{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	String s="name";
	System.out.pritln(s)

}

}


class shubham{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("hello")
	sb.append("shubham")
	System.out.pritln(sb)

}

}
